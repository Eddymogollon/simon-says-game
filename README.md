##Simon Says Game

This is a clone based on the famous Simon game that checks your memory skills.

Features:
- If you do 20 repetitions you will win the game.
- You can have a strict mode where if you lose, you lose all your process.
- You have a counter showing you in which level you currently are.

It was hella fun programming it!

The project was created on CodePen so the code is also there, check it out:
